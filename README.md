# LMS plugin PowerOutages

Shows power outages in areas served by Tauron.

## Installation

* Copy files to `<path-to-lms>/plugins/`
* Run `composer update` or `composer update --no-dev`
* Go to LMS website and activate it `Configuration => Plugins`
* Set data with best suits to you in file `modules/poweroutages.php`

## How to add your area?

We need to do some reverse engineering to get result in JSON format.

First open web browser and go to https://www.tauron-dystrybucja.pl/wylaczenia/wylaczenia-oddzialy
then press F12 in and look for XHR type files to find other locations

Examples:
1) miasto KnurÃ³w => gaid: 502 => type: commune
2) powiat gliwicki => gaid: 6 => type: district

Of course there are much more variables but this plugin don't cover all of them.
